# RequestSpec Example

A practical, real-world example showing how to build a complete networking layer using RequestSpec.

## What This Does

This example connects to [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) (a free fake REST API) and demonstrates all the common patterns you'll need when building your own API clients.

## What's Inside

- **Complete API coverage** for 6 resources (Posts, Comments, Albums, Photos, Todos, Users)
- **24+ working examples** covering all HTTP methods
- **Clean architecture** with protocols, services, and models
- **Detailed documentation** with inline comments and explanations

## How to Run

```bash
cd Examples/RequestSpecExample
swift run
```

That's it! The example will execute all API calls and print the results.

## Quick Start

Open `RequestSpecExample.swift` and explore:
- Lines ~120-395: Example demonstrations
- Lines ~395-590: Service layer architecture
- Lines ~810+: RequestSpec definitions (the good stuff!)

Each request is documented with what it does and why. Perfect for learning by example!

**Don't forget to check the request definitions at the bottom to see RequestSpec in action!**
